Calculating your own parameters
--------------------------------
In this tutorial you will calculate various SUEWS parameters before running the model for the specific site and vegetation type. The parameters discussed here are: LAI, albedo, surface roughness length and displacement height, and surface conductances. The Figures below shows how the order the parameters should be derived:

In this example we use meteorological observations from AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) network. The data required are air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, upwelling shortwave radiation, station pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, net all-wave radiation, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux, ideally storage heat flux (os soil heat flux if a simple surface), and the momentum flux. Wind direction is also very helpful.
