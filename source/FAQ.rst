FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
--------------------------------

Here we ensemble common questions that appear throughout the workshop. 

**Daily shading**

* I can see shadow patterns during the sunshine hours which is logical. Is it also possible to get a complete dark profile during nights? Because in the shadow animation I can only see the pictures during the day.(What IF I want to have for the complete day)?
    The animation is only for daytime when it comes to using the Shadow casting tool. This is because no data is created during night. You can have a look in the outout folder and see the geotiif that are created.

* On the 21. Dec there is not really a clear difference between Building Shadows and Building+Veg Shadows as it was on 21. June, is that correct?
    Yes. You are in Sweden with very low sun elevations and 4-5 level buildings. That results in that no vegetation shadow reach the ground.
