.. _SuPy4:

SuPy - interacting with external models
---------------------------------------

**This will take:**  ~30 minutes

Prior to this activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Understand the basic data structures of SuPy forcing:

   - basics given in `SuPy3`
   - more details see `SuPy manual <https://supy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-structure/supy-io.html#df_forcing:-forcing-data>`_

Activity
~~~~~~~~

-  In this activity, you will `build a simple model for anthropogenic heat and use it to interact with SuPy for urban climate simulations(T) <https://supy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/external-interaction.html>`_
   - An AmeriFlux site will be used as example.
