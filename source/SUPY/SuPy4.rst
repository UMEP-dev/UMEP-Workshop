.. _SuPy4:

SuPy - interacting with external models
---------------------------------------

**This will take:**  ~25 minutes

**Prior to this activity**

-  Understand the basic data structures of SuPy forcing:

   - basics given in the `SuPy impact study <SuPy3>`
   - more details see `SuPy manual <https://supy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-structure/supy-io.html#df_forcing:-forcing-data>`_

**Activity**


-  In this activity, you will `build a simple model for anthropogenic heat emissions and use it to interact with SuPy for urban climate simulations <https://supy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/external-interaction.html>`_

**Background**


- `Anthropogenic heat schemes used in SUEWS <https://suews-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameterisations-and-sub-models.html#anthropogenic-heat-flux-qf>`_
