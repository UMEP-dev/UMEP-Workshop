**Activity**


-  In this activity you use will use SuPy to conduct an `impact
   study <https://SuPy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/impact-studies-parallel.html>`__

   You will explore the urban climate response to two scenarios:

   1. modified urban surface properties (e.g., albedo), such as may come about from people's behaviour (e.g. planning regulations, manintenace over time)

   2. varying atmospheric forcing (e.g., air temperature), such as may come about from climate changing
