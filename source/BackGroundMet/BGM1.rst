    AmeriFlux
        The `AmeriFlux network <https://ameriflux.lbl.gov>`_
        is a community of sites
        and scientists measuring ecosystem carbon, water,
        and energy fluxes across the Americas,
        and committed to producing
        and sharing high quality eddy covariance data.

    LAI
        Leaf Area Index

    EC
        Eddy Covariance - a technique to measure turbulent heat, mass (e.g. water, :math:`CO_2`) and momentum fluxes.
