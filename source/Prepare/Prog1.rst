**Structure**

-  Each section has its own page with links to relevant materials.
-  Initial material is general, later topics are more focused
-  The amount of time needed to undertake a topic is given
-  At the end of each page the 'Next' button takes you forward
-  On each page there is guidance on what to do if you get stuck

**Delivery**

Beyond the workshop manual there are videos, tutorials, lectures and links to other material (e.g. manuals, articles). This a hands on workshop. People will be avalable to help throughout.
