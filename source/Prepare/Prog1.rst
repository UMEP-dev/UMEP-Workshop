Workshop Program: 8 - 10 July 2020
----------------------------------

**Welcome to the `urbisphere <http://urbisphere.eu/>`_ 2020 Modelling Workshop**

Given this is the first *urbisphere* Modelling workshop our main goal is to get everyone familiar with several modelling tools that already exist.

As this is an online workshop (rather than being at University of Reading as planned) we will meet twice a day via TEAMS formally but we will keep the TEAMS channels open throughout each session so you can ask questions of each other and the people ready to provide help.

**Structure**

-  Each section has its own page with links to relevant materials.
-  Initial material is general, later topics are more focused
-  The amount of time needed to undertake a topic is given
-   If you have gone to a tutorial site (these are hosted separately) make certain you return to the Workshop pages! At the end of each Workshop page the 'Next' button takes you forward.
-  On each page there is a link to the `Need help page <NeedHelp>` where you will see various ways to move forward if someone is not available to help you (suggestions for improving this would be good).

**Delivery**

Beyond the workshop manual there are videos, tutorials, lectures and links to other material (e.g. manuals, articles). This a hands on workshop. People will be avalable to help throughout.
